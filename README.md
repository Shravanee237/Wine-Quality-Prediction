# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting wine quality based on its chemical characteristics using machine learning. The dataset includes features like density, acidity, and other chemical properties, which are used to classify wine quality.

Key Components:
Machine Learning Models: Implementing Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC).
Data Processing: Using Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical operations.
Visualization: Leveraging Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore data patterns and insights.
